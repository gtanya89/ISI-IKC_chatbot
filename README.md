# ISI-IKC_chatbot

The objective of the project is to build a chatbot to interact with user assisting him to formulate a better understanding of the workflow if the research paper.

As a first step, we are looking at converting RDF triples to text.

The overall flow of the system is as follows:

User I/P -> Formulate Query -> Query Knowledge Base -> Produce O/P text to user

We will base out of a pre-defined grammar for the user. ->Task 1

We will look into summarization algorithms that will be best suited for our needs. ->Task 2

The overall goal is to be able to incorporate natural language in interaction with the user.

Work Plan (will be edited on a periodic basis):

### March 2, 2017:

1) Go through all papers in detail, especially to understand to convert RDF triples to text.

  * http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1486/paper_2.pdf
  * http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~orb/papers/d2t_2015.pdf
  
2) Go through papers on summarization algorithms to see how should we be able to combine/contract narratives.

3) Define the pre-set grammar for the user to use. ex. "less" for contracting the information presented

4) Define the project blocks to be built.
